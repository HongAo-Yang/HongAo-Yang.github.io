				In this work, we identify a new class of planar nodal chains in non-symmorphic phononic
				systems, where the connecting rings lie in the same plane. The constituting nodal rings are
				protected by mirror symmetry, and their intersection is guaranteed by the combination of
				time-reversal and non-symmorphic twofold screw symmetry. The connecting points are fourfold
				degenerate while those in previous works are twofold degenerate. We found 8 out of 230 space
				groups that can host the proposed planar nodal chain phonons. Taking wurtzite GaN (space
				group No. 186) as an example, the planar nodal chain is confirmed by first-principles
				calculations. The planar nodal chains result in two distinct classes of drumhead surface
				states on the [10(–1)0] and the [0001] surface Brillouin zones.

				Existing machine learning potentials for predicting phonon properties of crystals are
				typically limited on a material-to-material basis, primarily due to the exponential scaling
				of model complexity with the number of atomic species. We address this bottleneck with the
				developed Elemental Spatial Density Neural Network Force Field, namely Elemental-SDNNFF. The
				effectiveness and precision of our Elemental-SDNNFF approach are demonstrated on 11,866
				full, half, and quaternary Heusler structures spanning 55 elements in the periodic table by
				prediction of complete phonon properties. Self-improvement schemes including active learning
				and data augmentation techniques provide an abundant 9.4 million atomic data for training.
				Deep insight into predicted ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 774 Heusler structures
				is gained by p–d orbital hybridization analysis. Additionally, a class of two-band charge-2
				Weyl points, referred to as "double Weyl points", are found in 68% and 87% of 1662 half and
				1550 quaternary Heuslers, respectively.

				Lattice dynamics (LD) enables the calculation of mode-resolved transmittance of phonons
				passing through an interface, which is essential for understanding and controlling the
				thermal boundary conductance (TBC). However, the original LD method may yield unphysical
				transmittance over 100% due to the absence of the constraint of energy conservation. Here,
				we present a robust LD algorithm that utilizes linear algebra transformations and projection
				gradient descent iterations to ensure energy conservation. The evanescent modes and
				localized effects at the interface are revealed. In addition, bottom-up analysis of the
				phonon transmittance shows that the anisotropy in the azimuth angle can be ignored, while
				the dependency on the frequency and polar angle can be decoupled. The decoupled expression
				reproduces the TBC precisely.
